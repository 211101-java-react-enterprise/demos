Node.js 

	Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform "runtime environment" for Javascript. 
	It's the Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, ripped out of the browser. 
	
	It allows us to execute JS code outside of a web browser and provides us a variety of 
	Javascript modules/files. 

	When we install node.js, we also get the npm. (NPM will be very useful this week)

npm - Node Package Manager

	npm is a package manager for Node and allows us to locally install useful libraries. 


Single Page Applications?
	An application with a single page. React and Angular focus on making Single page applications. 
	
	A single page application, has a single html file, that is typically called Index.html . 
	Instead of navigating to another html file, when you're clicking on a link, it will use DOM manipluation to 
	recreate the same HTML page. 

	
	SPA is a web applicaiton that fits on a single page in the browser. 
	All the necessary code: HTML, JS, CSS is retrieved by the browser in a single load. 
	So thather than navigation on a website being avhieved using multiple (static) html pages, we will 
	dynamically modify elements within the page. 
 
	Advantages: 
		Fast and responsive: SPA only updates the required elements/content. 
			So HTML , CSS and JS are only loaded once. This is *significantly* faster than normal navigation. 
		Caching capabilities: SPA can cache rquest locally, it can reuse the data and to an extent even work offline. 
			(with the data being synchronised with the server when possible)

	Disadvantages: 
		Data is frontloaded: the first page is going to be loaded slower because it's loading up everything on the first 
			request (but overall it will stil be quicker once you start using it) 
		Poor performance in engine optimization: (minor disadvantage) 
		SPA are less secure towards Cross-site (XSS) attacks.
